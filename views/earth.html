        <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is so far the only place we know is inhabited by living things (us!).
            Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the sun. All other planets are named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses,
            however, earth is the only one that isn't. It's based on a Germanic word meaning "the ground".
